        "description": "From the math student through IT Engineer to the Senior Software Engineer. From the small company where were no documentation, version control and tests I could start my work for automotive customers in Capgemini through all levels of programming (intern - senior software engineer) with many technologies and frameworks. Later worked for other company to learn the specificity of projects for financial customers. Then worked again for the automotive customers in the Deloitte ADS. Now working as a Freelancer. Concentrated on the backend and the frontend. As next I want to improve my knowledge about cloud computing services (aws). I can also learn new technologies when needed."
